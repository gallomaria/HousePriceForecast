# House prices forcast
## Objective of the Analysis
The primary goal of this analysis is to predict house prices based on a large set of explanatory variables. To achieve this, various predictive models will be evaluated and compared using mean squared error (MSE) calculated on the log-transformed values of the response variable. The model that demonstrates the lowest mean squared error will be selected for making predictions.
